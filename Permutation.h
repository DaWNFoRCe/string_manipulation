 * @class Permutation
 * @brief
 * Class containing generic function declarations and non-logic centric functionality (generic class properties).
 * @details 
 * Designed to avoid code repetition of generic code. This includes state variables and main declarations. It also implements the input property given that is non logic-centrinc. This makes this class an hybrid in between an Interface and an ordinary class.

     Method receives an array position, and generates the permutation of all possible elements on that position of the elements allocated between the "start" index and the end of the string. For every permutation it executes a recursive call and moves the "start" index one position ahead, until there are no more elements to permute. This expansion takes form of a tree were the leaves are all possible permutations of the string. The function is written in such a way it optimizes memory use, just spanding one branch at the time, hence reducing the stack space needed, given its exponential nature.
     * @param start next array position to analyzed
     * @param input number to be added
     * @return 1 in case of success
     * @exception NA (could be added under request)
