# string_manipulation
It includes 3 C++ files that in turn return all the permutations,  all unique permutations, and all repeated permutations up to a threshold
3 Items to mention:
It works on STL no external libraries were used.
I am aware coupling and composition could be improved but that would defeat the puspose of increasing complexity
Im aware of next permutation, but I felt that would defeat the purpose of the exercise 
All are standalone. I alow myself to put some repetitive non logic related functionality on a separate hybrid class (in between an interface and abstract class) to simplify the code and improve readibility. Note however that the Permutatiion.h was completely programmed by me as well
